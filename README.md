# This is my first official repo! 
# I am very new to github in terms of creating my own repo and adding files.

# today (08/06/2023) I have decided to start editing my own repo again :) 
#This is almost a coding journey with personal projects and different coding experiments.


# okay, mic drop. Thanks for coming to my ted talk!
